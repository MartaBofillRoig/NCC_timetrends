This repository contains the main code and R functions to reproduce the results of the simulation study in ``On model-based time trend adjustments in platform trials with non-concurrent controls'' (XXX).

We investigated frequentist, model-based approaches to adjust for time trends in platform trials utilizing non-concurrent controls. We investigated conditions under which the model-based approaches can successfully adjust for time trends for the simple case of a two-period trial with two experimental treatments and a shared control. We focus on a platform trial  with two treatment arms and a common control arm. Assuming that the second treatment arm is added at a later time period, we assess  the robustness of recently proposed model-based approaches  to adjust for time trends when utilizing non-concurrent controls. The following figure illustrates the design considered:

# R Functions

The folder _functions_ contains all R functions necessary to reproduce the results and figures in the main paper and supplementary material:

## Functions for data generation

- **trend_functions.R**: Contains functions ``linear_trend()`` and ``sw_trend()`` that are used to generate linear or stepwise trend in the main paper and the function ``linear_trend2()`` that is used to simulate linear trend that starts in the second period in the supplementary material.

- **data_sim_block.R**: The function ``data_sim_block()`` simulates continuous or binary data for two-stage platform trial using block randomization and deterministic patient entry times, based on given sample sizes, effect sizes and time trend specifications. This function is used for data generation in the main paper.

- **data_sim_brdt.R**: The function ``data_sim_brdt()`` simulates continuous or binary data for two-stage platform trial using block randomization and random patient entry times.

- **data_sim.R**: The function ``data_sim()`` simulates continuous or binary data for two-stage platform trial using simple randomization per period and deterministic patient entry times.

- **data_sim_rdt.R**: The function ``data_sim_rdt()`` simulates continuous or binary data for two-stage platform trial using simple randomization per period and random patient entry times.

## Functions for tests and models

- **z_test.R**: Contains functions ``z_test_pol()`` and ``z_test_sep()`` that perform pooled or separate one-sided z-test with the given data.

- **t_test.R**: Contains functions ``t_test_pol()`` and ``t_test_sep()`` that perform pooled or separate one-sided t-test with the given data.

- **linear_model.R**: Contains functions ``linear_model_a1()``, ``linear_model_a1_int()``, ``linear_model_a2()``, ``linear_model_a2_int()``, ``linear_model_b1()`` and ``linear_model_b2()`` that are used to fit different linear regression models (ALLTC-Linear, ALLTCI-Linear, ALLTC-Step, ALLTCI-Step, TC-Linear and TC-Step) to given data.

- **z_prop_test.R**: Contains function ``z_prop_pol()`` and ``z_prop_sep()`` that perform pooled or separate one-sided two-proportions z-test for with the given data.

- **log_model.R**: Contains functions ``logistic_model_a1()``, ``logistic_model_a1_int()``, ``logistic_model_a2()``, ``logistic_model_a2_int()``, ``logistic_model_b1()``, ``logistic_model_b2()``, ``logistic_model_sep()`` and ``logistic_model_pol()`` that are used to fit different logistic regression models (ALLTC-Linear, ALLTCI-Linear, ALLTC-Step, ALLTCI-Step, TC-Linear, TC-Step and separate and pooled logistic model) to given data.

## Functions for simulations

- **allinone_model.R**: The function ``allinone_model()`` is programmed to call all the aforementioned functions and return the calculated metrics (T/F for reject $H_{02}$ and bias) from all considered tests and models.

- **allinone_sim.R**: The function ``allinone_simsce()`` takes a data frame with different simulation scenarios as input and performs _nsim_ replications for each of them to simulate the type I error rate/power, bias and rMSE.

- **allinone_sim_par.R**: The function ``allinone_simsce_par()`` is a parallelized version of ``allinone_simsce()``.


# Main paper

## Main simulation script and results

- **mainpaper_script.R**: Script with all scenarios considered in the study. Simulates given scenarios and saves the results as .csv files in the folder _results_. 

Running this script results in 100 separate .csv files, named **results_bin_trendpattern_parametrization_hypothesis_trendtype.csv** or **results_cont_trendpattern_hypothesis_trendtype.csv** depending on whether the simulated data were binary or continuous.


-	For binary endpoints, the given scenario is indicated in the file name as   **results_bin_trendpattern_parametrization_hypothesis_trendtype.csv**, where

    - for **trendpattern**, we considered the options:

        - **inv_1** - inverted-U trend with peak in the middle of period 1
        - **inv_2** - inverted-U trend with peak between period 1 and 2
        - **inv_3** - inverted-U trend with peak in the middle of period 2
        - **lin** - linear trend
        - **step** - stepwise trend

    - for **parametrization**, we considered:

        - **add** - additive parametrization
        - **mult** - multiplicative parametrization

    - for **hypothesis**, we considered:

        - **alpha** - simulations of the type I error under the null hypothesis
        - **pow** - simulations of the power under the alternative hypothesis

    - for **trendtype**, we considered:

        - **eq** - equal time trend in all arms
        - **diff_pos** - positive time trend in control and arm 2, varying trend in arm 1
        - **diff_neg** - negative time trend in control and arm 2, varying trend in arm 1

    - additionally, **OR1** refers to scenarios with OR1>1, otherwise OR1<1 is used



-	For continuous endpoints, the given scenario is indicated in the file name as follows: **results_cont_trendpattern_hypothesis_trendtype.csv**, where

    -	for **trendpattern**, we considered:

        -	**inv_1** - inverted-U trend with peak in the middle of period 1
        -	**inv_2** - inverted-U trend with peak between period 1 and 2
        -	**inv_3** - inverted-U trend with peak in the middle of period 2
        -	**lin** - linear trend
        -	**step** - stepwise trend

    -	for **hypothesis**, we considered:

# Supplementary material 

The folder _Supp\_mat_ contains additional results regarding different randomization procedures discussed in the Supplementary material. Results that are reported in Section 3 of the Supplementary material are simulated in the ``Supp_mat_randomization.Rmd`` script and presented in the corresponding HTML file.

# Figures

- **Plots_paper.Rmd**: generates all figures used in the main paper and supplementary material and saves them in the folder _figures_. 

Figures presented in the main paper have the suffix **\_main** (e.g. **cont_response_main.png**), while figures included in the supplementary material are indicated by the suffix **\_supp** (e.g. **cont_all_eq_bias_supp.png**).
