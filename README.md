Model-based time trend adjustments in platform trials with
non-concurrent controls
================

This repository contains the main code and R functions to reproduce the
results of the simulation study in \`\`On model-based time trend
adjustments in platform trials with non-concurrent controls’’ (XXX).

We investigated frequentist, model-based approaches to adjust for time
trends in platform trials utilizing non-concurrent controls. We
investigated conditions under which the model-based approaches can
successfully adjust for time trends for the simple case of a two-period
trial with two experimental treatments and a shared control.

Outline structure repository.

## Main simulation script:

  - **mainpaper\_script.R**: Script with all scenarios considered in the
    study. Simulates given scenarios and saves the results as .csv files
    in the folder *results*.

## Example??

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

… Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
